# Getting Started With Your Mini

---
#### What You Will Need
  * Your Bitcoin Mini - you can order one at http://bitcoinmini.com
  * The flash drive (included)
  * Mini power adapter (included)
  * Ethernet cable (included)
  * Your home router
    * The admin login credentials usually found on your router

#### Plug and Play
  * Plug the flash drive into any USB on the Mini.
  * Plug one end of the ethernet cable into the router and the other into the Mini
  * Plug in the power
You are done. The Mini will boot up and sync itself to the bitcoin network. You don't have to do anything else to function as a full node.

#### Accessing Your User Interface
You should now be able to access your UI. But you don't know what IP it has on your local network. Let's find that out.

Open a browser window and type in the IP address from your admin credentials on your router. Usually it's something like 168.192.0.1. When there you can log into your admin settings. Each make and model of router is a little different, but you should be able to navigate your way to the connected devices page. There you'll find a list of devices and their internal IP addresses. These are address your router uses to direct information on your network. "mini00x" is your Mini. Copy and paste the IP address into a new window. Your done.

It should look something like this "168.192.0.xxx", where xxx is a number.
